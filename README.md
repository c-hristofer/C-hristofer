# Hi, I'm Christofer Piedra 👋  
** B.S. Computer Science | AI Minor & B.B.A. Business Administration 
**Awards:** 2024 FAU Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow 

With a passion for innovation and a foundation in both technology and business, I specialize in creating real-world solutions that merge secure systems, intelligent automation, and strategic user experience. I bring:

- 💻 **Technical agility** across full-stack web development, machine learning, and network security  
- 📊 **Business insight** shaped by leadership roles and a dual degree in CS + Management  
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity fluency** through research at FAU’s Tecore Lab, building systems to detect threats like DDoS and ARP poisoning  

I’m excited to connect with innovators and problem-solvers across tech, education, and entrepreneurship. Currently seeking opportunities in **technical product management, cybersecurity, or software engineering** where I can scale ideas into impact.
