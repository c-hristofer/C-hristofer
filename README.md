  ### **FAU Tecore Testbed** – *Python + Zeek + InfluxDB + VMs*  
  - Designed a virtual testbed to simulate and detect cyberattacks (DDoS, Port Scan, ARP Poisoning)  
  - Developed a secure login system and InfluxDB-based dashboard to monitor real-time traffic  
  - Configured Zeek scripts for anomaly detection; used virtual machines for attack isolation and repeatability  
  - Visualized and logged threats to assist in intrusion prevention research  

  ### **FlightPath** – *React + Next.js + Firebase*  
  - Led front-end and back-end development for a senior design project aimed at bridging students, faculty, and employers  
  - Built secure, scalable UI with responsive design principles and Firebase integration  
  - Developed dynamic routing for user-specific dashboards (students, employers, advisors)  
  - Features planned: Mobile version, University SSO integration, and analytics tracking  

  ### **Wordle Solver** – *Python + NLP-inspired heuristics*  
  - Designed an efficient solver using word frequency analysis, letter position heuristics, and candidate pruning  
  - Solves Wordle puzzles in fewer than 4 guesses on average  
  - Mimics human-like feedback interpretation using green/yellow/gray coloring logic
