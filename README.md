### **GPT-Style Transformer from Scratch** – *Python · PyTorch*  
_July 2025_
- Tokenizer, multi-head self-attention, layer normalization, positional encoding, and feed-forward layers  
- Trained on small poetry and code corpora to demonstrate coherent next-token prediction  
- Visualized attention maps and loss convergence; packaged as easy-to-follow notebook

### **FlightPath** – *React + Next.js + Firebase*  
_April 2025 – Present_  
- Led front-end and back-end development for a senior design project aimed at bridging students, faculty, and employers  
- Built secure, scalable UI with responsive design principles and Firebase integration  
- Developed dynamic routing for user-specific dashboards (students, employers, advisors)  
- Features planned: Mobile version, University SSO integration, and analytics tracking

### **Makemore Character-Level Language Model** – *Python · NumPy*  
_May 2025 – July 2025_  
- Implemented from scratch: unigram → bigram → neural net with hidden layer → backpropagation → sampling  
- Explored softmax over character embeddings, training loops, and gradient descent  
- Generated plausible “names” and text snippets, visualizing loss curves and sample outputs  

### **AI Basketball Predictor** – *Python · TensorFlow · Scikit-learn · Pandas · NumPy*  
_May 2025 – July 2025_  
- Built and compared two models (neural network & random forest) to predict game outcomes and player performance  
- Engineered features from historical box-score data, play-by-play logs, and advanced metrics  
- Tuned hyperparameters via grid search and cross-validation, achieving > 75% game-result accuracy  
- Packaged as a reusable Python module and deployed evaluation dashboard

### **FAU Tecore Testbed** – *Python + Zeek + InfluxDB + VMs*  
_May 2024 – Present_  
- Simulates DDoS, port-scan, ARP-poisoning, and more attacks in containerized VMs  
- Streams ingress traffic to an InfluxDB dashboard for real-time anomaly detection  
- Configured secure logins, CI/CD pipelines, and Zeek scripts for research reproducibility
- Visualized and logged threats to assist in intrusion prevention research

### Under Review  
**Title:** *Common Cybersecurity Attack Types and Zeek-Based Detection Strategies in IoT Networks*  
**Journal:** Florida Atlantic Undergraduate Research Journal (FAURJ)  
**Status:** Submitted; under peer review  
**Co-author:** Dr. Imad Mahgoub  
**Abstract Summary:**  
> This manuscript delivers a systematic taxonomy of five principal IoT network threats—reconnaissance; denial-of-service (DoS/DDoS); brute-force intrusions; man-in-the-middle and spoofing; and botnet/malware exploitation—and introduces a suite of Zeek-based detection algorithms. Detailed pseudocode is provided for each strategy, and empirical validation on publicly available IoT traffic datasets demonstrates robust, real-time detection performance and scalable throughput under varying load conditions.

### Fellowship Research Presentation  
**Project:** *Security Enhancement of the FAU Tecore Lab IoT Testbed*  
**Event:** FAU Summer Fellowship Showcase  
**Date:** August 2024  
**Highlights:**  
- **Authentication & Access Control:** Engineered a Node.js/Firebase module enforcing secure, role-based logins across VM-based IoT networks.  
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Designed an interactive InfluxDB dashboard to display simulated DDoS, port-scan, and ARP-poisoning traffic.  
- **Anomaly Detection:** Developed modular Zeek IDS scripts with optimized routines for low-latency flagging in a reproducible virtual environment.
